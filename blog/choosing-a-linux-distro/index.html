          <p>
            When I first started using Linux, I spent way too much time
            searching for the perfect distro. My problem? None of them looked
            quite the way I wanted, I was ridiculously picky about aesthetics.
            Back then, I cared more about how it looked than how it worked.
          </p>
          <h2>Design</h2>
          
          <p>The design of a linux distro really change the experience to me. If it doesn't look good, it's a hard pass. So I've gathered 5 best designed distros that I think you will enjoy.</p>
          <a href="https://garudalinux.org/editions?edition=mokka">
            <h3>1. Garuda Mokka (KDE)</h3>
          </a>
          <ul>
            <img src="https://garudalinux.org/assets/editions/garuda-mokka.webp" alt="garuda mokka img" class="display">
            <br>
            <p>This is Garuda Mokka out of the box. Personally, I love it.</p>
            <p>It's a Catppuccin pastel themed KDE desktop environment.</p>
            <p>It's easy to use and it has an amazing design. The only downside is that it's a little more intensive on your computer's resources.</p>
            <p>In order to use Garuda Mokka, you must meet the minimum requirements:</p>
            <li>
              30GB Storage Space
            </li>
            <li>
              4GB of RAM
            </li>
            <li>
              A GPU that supports at least OpenGL 3.3
            </li>
            <li>
              Your computer must have a 64-bit processor
            </li>
            <li>
              And a USB stick with at least 4GB of storage space to flash the ISO on there. 
            </li>
          </ul>

          <a href="https://zorin.com/os/">
            <h3>2. Zorin OS (GNOME... sort of)</h3>
          </a>
          <ul>
            <img src="https://i2.wp.com/fostips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zorinos-darkmode.jpg?fit=1440%2C900&ssl=1" alt="zorin os img" class="display">
            <br>
            <p>This is Zorin OS out of the box. It's not as great as Garuda Mokka personally, but I can see many people liking it.</p>
            <p>It's very easy and friendly to use and it has an good design. Though, you are more limited to customization compared to Garuda Mokka.</p>
            <p>Also, there's a free and paid version of Zorin OS, which sucks to me. Though it is good for the developers so they can get paid for their amazing work.</p>
            <p>In order to use Zorin OS, you must meet the minimum requirements:</p>
            <li>
              15GB Storage Space for Core
              32GB Storage Space for Education
              40GB Storage Space for Pro
            </li>
            <li>
              2GB of RAM
            </li>
            <li>
              1 GHz Dual Core CPU
            </li>
            <li>
              Your computer must have a 64-bit processor
            </li>
          </ul>

          <a href="https://system76.com/pop/pop-beta/">
            <h3>3. Pop!_OS (Heavily Customized Gnome)</h3>
          </a>
          <ul>
            <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-pywjnxrcr2/images/stencil/original/image-manager/pop-beta-panels.png?t=1758745926" alt="pop os img" class="display">
            <br>
            <p>This is Pop!_OS out of the box. It looks very different from what you'd see in a bare bones Gnome Environment.</p>
            <p>It's sort of easy to use, but you have to get used to it's quirks (Though it isnt much), and it looks amazing.</p>
            <p>Since it's Gnome, you can't customize it as much as Garuda Mokka. But it's still possible, though you won't need to change too much to get Pop!_OS to look good.</p>
            <p>In order to use this, you must meet the minimum requirements:</p>
            <li>
              16GB Storage Space
            </li>
            <li>
              4GB of RAM
            </li>
            <li>
              Intel or AMD graphics or 10 series NVIDIA and older
            </li>
            <li>
              Your computer must have a 64-bit processor
            </li>
            <li>
              And a USB stick with at least 3GB of storage space to flash the ISO on there. It does't exactly say, but given that the file size is 2.75GB, 3GB of Storage Space on your USB Stick should be fine.
            </li>
          </ul>
