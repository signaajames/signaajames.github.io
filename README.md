# Signaa James Portfolio

This is my portfolio, built with vanilla JavaScript, Vite, and custom CSS.

## Getting Started

You will need a newer version of Node, I'm using v22.18.0. I can't say for sure if older/newer versions will work though, but v22... should work.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL (defaults to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) to view the portfolio in development mode.
